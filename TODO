* Make the tree editor useful:
  * Folding, max-depth under which you jump to a new root

  * Revision control

* Interpret Tree as Code!
  * Scheme / Untyped Haskell
  * Run as you edit
  * Finally editing some code.. UI enhancements...

* Add typing:
  * Full type inference
  * Back-refs from all uses: When "x" changes its type, re-test all
    uses of "x" for validity, if invalid, insert tchorim
